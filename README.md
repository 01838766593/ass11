## Project detailes

In this project I created an online teaching platform by React. I changed the title and made an user friendly teaching site. Where user can easily get their desire courses in a very reasonable price from homewithout any outgoing journey pressure. Here you can get an attractive customize user UI where you can review allthe packages & courses in the site. Most importantly, I added here 4 routes like( Home, About, Service, Instructor) with header & footer and one error routes. Overall I tried my best to make an updated teaching platform.
